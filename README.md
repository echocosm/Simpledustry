This Mod is in early-development and removes details from the vanilla textures of Mindustry!
There are still a lot of textures missing and some might aren't working but I will fix these problems step-by-step.
All textures are made by Yoru Kitsune. Some textures added by echocosm using flaticon

This mod was inspired by the Simplistic - Texturepack by EchoVespy, who unfortunatly stopped working on it.
I got some bugs of the Simplistic mod fixed and I try to extend the mod, by completly redesigning the sprites.
If there are sprites in this mod that look the exact same as in the Simplistic mod, I didn't steal them... we just have the same goal and the same base textures.

If you want to help making this big mod, please read the [Contibuting](https://github.com/Yoru-Kitsune/Simpledustry/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) page.

If you want also the UI elements made for this mod, download the [ui-pack](https://github.com/Yoru-Kitsune/Simpledustry-ui-pack).

All textures redesigned or added after the 16th of july 2023 now have the fixed lighting. A small detail but it is now a bit more vanilla-likely.
